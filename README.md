## Overview

As an Ohio State student, I built Buckeye GPT to solve a simple problem - advanced AI chatbots are expensive. This production-grade platform provides my fellow classmates free access to the latest language models, the same ones that typically cost $20/month. While NOT affiliated with Ohio State officials, this personal project represents my commitment to both technical excellence and AI equity.

## Why Use Buckeye GPT?

Built with the community in mind, the platform offers:

- üÜì **Free Access**: The same advanced AI models you'd pay $20/month for elsewhere
- üîí **Privacy First**: Your data stays protected, with transparent security measures
- üéì **Student Focus**: Features built around real academic needs and workflows
- ‚ö° **Reliability**: Production-quality infrastructure for consistent performance

## Development Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Buckeye GPT is currently in pre-1.0 development. While the platform is stable for end users, the codebase is undergoing significant architectural changes. Public contributions will be welcomed after v1.0.0 release.
